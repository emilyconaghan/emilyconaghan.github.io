        <h1>Hi there... I'm Emily!</h1>
        <h1>Nice to meet you! </h1>

        <h2>So… Do you want the short story, or the long story? </h2>
        <h2>Oh… The medium story? I guess I can do that too…</h2>
        <p> I graduated high school with a glint in my eye and the ambition to be a doctor. I started studying a
            Bachelor of Biomedical Science at The University of Queensland. After a handful of chemistry classes, I
            quickly realised that I didn’t want to be a doctor… I had in fact, just watched too much Grey’s Anatomy.
        </p>

        <p>So with a change of direction, I transferred to Queensland University of Technology to undertake a Bachelor
            of Business, majoring in Human Resources and a Bachelor of Creative Industries, majoring in Music. </p>

        <p>After graduating, I spent some time consulting and then moved into an internal recruitment role which leads
            me to where I am today! </p>

        <p>I am currently an Account Manager at <a class="a1" href="https://huntandco.io/">Hunt & Co.</a> Hunt & Co. is
            a digital recruitment agency here in Brisbane. We specialise in recruiting roles within digital and
            technology and we’re motivated by our nobel purpose which is to make life changing connections. </p>

        <p>I specialise in recruiting within the Technology and Product spaces and have recruited roles throughout the
            entire career journey from graduate right through to executive level. </p>

        <p>One of my favourite parts of my job is that I've been able to create a series called What's The Stack, where
            alongside my colleague (and work-wife) <a class="a1"
                href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carly-shearman/">Carly Shearman</a> we get to interview some of the
            best and brightest members of the Brisbane tech community. I'd love for you to take a look, you can view the
            series <a class="a1" href="whats-the-stack.html">here</a> and keep an eye out for season 2, coming very
            soon. </p>

        <p>In 2022, I decided I wanted to take my recruitment career to the next level and so I applied for the She
            Codes program and I feel very lucky to say - I got in! </p>

        <p>For me, She Codes is about becoming a qualified member of the tech community. The tech community in Brisbane
            is a space that I am a part of, but I want to be able to further embed myself into the community and to
            really be able to ‘get it’ when I talk to developers about their next career move. </p>

        <p>Outside of work (and now coding…), I’m an avid puzzler and podcast listener. I also love going on long walks,
            bike rides and doing crafts (any kind of craft is fine - I’m craft agnostic…). </p>

        <p>If you have any questions, or would like to find out more, I’d love to have a chat. </p>

        <p>You can contact me <a class="a1" href="contact.html">here.</a></p>
